   - Every setback is an opportunity to learn and adjust

6. Remind People of Their Why
   - Know and frequently remind team members of their motivations
   - Use their 'why' to keep them moving forward

7. Develop Independent Leaders
   - Aim to create leaders who can function without constant guidance
   - Success comes from helping others succeed

## Advice for New Associates
1. Set proper expectations (there will be more "no's" than "yes's" initially)
2. Utilize the established system and training
3. Focus on getting paid, promoted, and fast-start qualified
4. Share the opportunity through videos and scripts provided
