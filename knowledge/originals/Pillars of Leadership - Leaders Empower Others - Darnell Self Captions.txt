so tonight i have an opportunity real quickly just to share a little bit about leading and empowering others this whole weekend was really about leadership and i prefaced that yesterday when i talked about this being different than our international convention this is an event where we have an opportunity to just become better and when we become better things around us become better because we see them as better even when the circumstances don't change it's the way you see the circumstance that change thereby it's seemingly changing and so what i want to talk about are some things that i've learned throughout my years of bumping my head and making a bunch of mistakes and leading a diverse group and i'm still making those mistakes by the way so this presentation isn't coming from a person that's perfected it because i actually don't even strive for perfection i strive for excellence and so perfection i'll never reach but i'm going to share with you all today some things that you can do to build an organization of independent leaders how many people want to build independent leaders now eric thomas yesterday said that it's in this i'm paraphrasing that is quite difficult if you're a one to lead anybody except to zero you all remember that which is true except for our industry it's so beautiful to be a part of a profession where you actually are not always the one leading the people on your team you're guiding the people on your team to people who can now lead those people on your team and what i want to teach you tonight is how to be a one but lead eight listen i don't want you to look at yourself in the mirror and say i'm not good enough i've got to wait until i become a nine before i can even introduce a ten and it's simply not the case in our profession this is why we are a part of the most beautiful industry in the world because you could absolutely be 82 years old and feel like i don't want to work that hard i'm 82 i've worked hard all of my life and introduced a 27 year old who works harder than you who does more than you and you benefit from it at 82. you could absolutely be a female and introduce a male who has an issue with being led by a female which i would never understand but that does exist yes let's talk facts so you can be a female and introduce a male who has a challenge with being led by a female but could still lead an entire team of men as a female who has entire team of men who bump their heads so hard that they have a problem with being led by a female you could have a ged never graduate from high school right or maybe you ended up getting the ged and still lead a team of folks who have phds and master degrees this is why you have no excuse i don't even know some of you and i can tell you that you too can be a platinum executive director because you too can be a two and have tens on your team who go executive and because those four people go executive you go platinum and you did not necessarily lead them to platinum you guided them to platinum [Applause] that's what i'm going to teach over the next few minutes you all ready [Applause] leadership so leaders become great not because of their power but rather their ability to empower others listen to what that says leaders become great not because of their own power but rather their ability to empower others so this doesn't have anything to do with your power but your ability to help others to feel empowered do you realize that you could have invited people here today and you didn't necessarily empower them but your ability to guide them here has them leaving feeling empowered see i'm taking it all off of you you have no excuses leaving here and not saying you can't go executive unless you're putting it all on you i'm going to show you how to how to take it off of you but yet to still have leaders who believe in you how do i know this is true because when mike humes joined our organization he had more than me he he had the car i was borrowing my father's pickup truck back then you had to have good credit to get a cell phone not sure if that's still true today but i could even get a cell phone except on his credit so if it was true in our industry that you could not lead anyone who's doing better than you then be no way that i could have guided mike humes to the position he's in today that should excite you today but you're probably wondering like how do you do it i'm gonna share that with you because i know some of you are still thinking well i just don't if you could just show me how to do that because yes i i know some people who are very influential in my community i have some family members who have accomplished a lot more than me i'm just unsure how to help them to feel empowered to do what i'm doing because they're looking at me they're they're judging me they're deciding whether they should be interested or not based on my own success in legal shield anybody know people like that so let's talk about understanding influence leaders have the capacity or the ability to direct the behaviors of others that's influence right so what you're doing is you're guiding the behavior of someone else you're helping someone else to do something that without your influence they wouldn't have done now watch this because this influence is critical and i've listened to the young pros talk about effective communication i've listened to all of our trainers throughout the weekend talk about the importance of celebrating wins which we'll talk about here as well but i want to help you guys really understand the importance of helping other people to feel good about moving forward even if it passes you up now this is this comes from language because if they feel like you don't want them to pass you and and look i i understand competition but if anyone feels like my leader's trying to hold me back my leader doesn't want to see me succeed my leader we have to take a look at look in the mirror and wonder why they feel that way instead of saying i can't believe you think that way they think that way for a reason and they listen they're entitled to think that way but as a great leader we look in the mirror and say how what am i saying or doing or not saying or not doing to to help them or to to to get get them to to feel that way so i wrote down a got a couple of bullet points for you that's going to help you out that helped me out so i thought i'd share with you all one ask permission to coach to improve their performance you guys got that one down ask permission this is going to be critical for you so i don't want to move too fast i need you guys to get that down you ask permission so it sounds something like this hey listen um i'm really excited about uh your potential here with legalshield and you know i'm just getting started myself or having all the success that i would like to but i'm connected to people who are doing extraordinarily well and i'd love to introduce you to them so even in asking permission to coach to improve their performance it doesn't mean that you're personally going to coach them but you can connect them to someone who's going to coach them you guys getting this if you say well i don't have a leader that i can connect someone with you have now opportunities virtually to still connect people once they join legalshield you have leadership shows and you can promote we have some of the most successful coaches and mentors and when you join this particular zoom we have at this date this time you're gonna have an opportunity to learn from the same people that are teaching me this is how i was able to impact my kim's performance before i was succeeding i was able to talk about other people so if you talk to mike humes and and talk about his first few years with me he'll talk about how i introduced him to certain people who were driving nicer cars than me who had more success than me so i was very intentional about that but how do you know how to guide these folks because people say a lot of different things and they confuse us right they say they're excited but they don't do anything right they say oh man i'm gonna be a millionaire but they don't show up on the zoom so watch this watch the difference between a a leader and a great leader because we're teaching how to become great leaders here this weekend that's why i'm glad you showed up in youtube virtually watch the difference a good leader still listens but they're listening to respond they're not listening to receive and the difference sounds like this your associate says something like hey listen um i'm just so stressed i feel like it's overwhelming so many calls so many zooms so many things going on a good leader not a great leader he listened she listened but they respond with something like this come on you're not stressed i mean going to your job is stressful so a good leader didn't really care what they said because that person just said they felt stressed so what they've what they're feeling is what they're feeling you can't tell them they're not feeling something they just told you they were feeling but a great leader says oh my gosh i'm so sorry to hear that what no what do you feel what what are the reasons why you're feeling so stressed let's talk about this and they have an opportunity to really hear what that person's feeling and why they're feeling and then they can say things like hey listen is there anything i can do to assist you is there anything i can do to help well listen they say well listen so many different calls so listen right now just worry about this one and this one because you're part-time but you didn't realize that until you had this conversation with him and now you took him from attending four different things throughout the week to two or maybe two to one i'm gonna talk about that in one second how to lower the assignments to empower people sometimes lowering the assignment you get people to do actually more course correct now listen you can't do course correction before listening that was the good leader wasn't a great leader the good leader still listens right and you'll get better along the way i don't want you to feel like you have to have all of this again perfected but the bottom line is someone who's great will listen first then course correct because the only reason you know how to course correct and of course correct by the way the course is not like a series of educational um lessons that's not the course i'm talking about i'm talking about like a lane um to get somewhere and when someone veers off the correction is bringing them back into the right lane so that's a course correction so if some if i'm listening to someone and they share something with me i can help course correct and say listen that's actually not what you're thinking it's actually this and i can help bring them back to the right path does this make sense to everybody but i don't know that unless i listen i do more listening than talking all day long and i know it sounds crazy like my gosh you gotta listen all day long all these folks well listen you can we make a lot of money for listening like a whole lot of money for listening because a lot of people will talk themselves in to getting right back on the right course speaking of being off course um i never forget going to atlanta with mr humes and we were on our way back and we couldn't afford to really stay in the hotel so we drove all the way down 10 hours and coming back and on the way back he was getting sleepy and you can tell when someone's getting sleepy because they have those things on the side of the road that make noise [Applause] i don't even know what they call but it's like like that so i was falling asleep but the woke me up so i said you good man and this is like two in the morning and he says you see them kids skipping across the road [Applause] i said what he said dude some kids holding hands were skipping across the road i said bro pull over actually that's not even the truth if you asked him the story he said you weren't that worried because you you say hey man let's put up get something to drink and you got to keep going cause i was i knew i could i would have seen kids too but the kids i was listening i heard the and i was able to course correct hey bro listen so listen up is all i'm saying that's a little joke but listen up because people will tell you when they're just about to quit they may not say the words i'm going to quit you know how many people we have on our team today that have rings that we're going to quit but if we listen to them we can help course correct sometimes they're just like they're just going this direction and we just course correct and now they're going this direction then we course correct they go in this direction in this direction is the ring that's all it's just listening hearing just asking questions so what's going on okay then share your experiences and share the experiences of others the reason why listen i know a lot of folks say well i know so much i don't need to join the zooms i don't need to join a leadership show i don't need to come to events like this and it's bigger than you coming to the event like this it's about getting your people to come to the event like this so they can get the experiences and hear the stories that you couldn't have shared on your own or stories that you would have forgotten to share but the stories that they wrote down that were important to them weren't the same stories that you would have written down that's why you can't bring back the notes you could bring back the notes but you can't bring back the experience you guys getting this and that's why it's so critical to have people here this is why i encourage the team to join the zoom hey listen i don't see you on the zoom yet and i'll talk about how to do that in just one second but hey listen i don't see you in the zoom yet hey are you joining the zoom so we all have to have that core group that we remind this is what this is how they get to sharing the experience but also share my own experiences but remember i said in the beginning that you could actually be a two and have an eight on your team here's how this works and the same thing and sharing your experiences and sharing the experiences of others i either share celebratory stories or warning stories celebratory stories or warning stories i tell stories about people who've consistently plugged in in the success that they've had and i've talked about people who have not plugged in in the fleeting success they've had because you can actually have success by not plugging in but it's typically fleeting success i don't know anyone who's had long-term growth in momentum without plugging in consistently because your teams do what you do and so when you don't show up you give them permission not to show up when you don't stay in your seat you give them permission yes so so so all i'm saying is that the reason why this works so well is because when i see a certain person doesn't show up a lot because i'm trying to empower the team this person is not showing up yet that's okay i'm not letting them go yet but i now work with the people on their team to share with them the experience that they can gain by staying plugged in because when i do that it the eight down here motivates the two here watch this watch this guys the two is not income defined is leadership defined eric thomas wasn't talking about income he's talking about leadership so i don't know you could you could have a 50 000 ring and be in two a two in leadership some of you may have been here in utah and i talked about uh at the leadership event and i talked about the five levels of leadership and so just because someone has a 50k ring they may be a two in leadership which means that they're talking to people like they have permission to talk to them when they only have the position to talk to them and so and because that person has not earned the permission yet and they say things that person is offended by because who are you to tell me that i don't even know you like that yet and so what happens is i have to step in when i see that and work with this is why you're here because you can learn not just how to lead but also to empower other people to become independent leaders and so i just can't take the chance of this person destroying the whole organization unintentionally so i step in and now lead this person because i may be at eight and now i can lead this four for this person because this person in between us or two is a two and we've been letting them leave because they've got the ring we've been letting them leave because they got a position and it's been killing our organizations because position would never outweigh permission [Music] but you only get that when you listen and you build a relationship with yourself because then people come to you and say listen i'm a little uncomfortable with my leader i'm a little uncomfortable doing three-way calls to this person and i would have never known that unless i listened and listened and built a relationship where they feel like they're comfortable enough to tell me these things you guys getting this okay i'm trying to i'm trying to keep it simplistic right i don't go over your head but but but i see millions for you in your life and the only reason you don't is because perhaps a mindset of scarcity because there's so many in here maybe you think there's not enough for everybody to make a million but that's only because you see small otherwise listen otherwise you see for yourself what i see for you and the only reason you may not see it for yourself is what i said in the beginning is because you're complaining listen you're you're beating yourself up thinking about you i'm sharing with you that your success can come from from other people beyond you away from you that's what's so exciting about what we do if you knew bryan carruthers knows but if you knew me from where i started and how i doubted myself this is how i can speak to you like this because i was the one doubting myself i was the one wondering if i could ever be on stage i was the one wondering if i could ever transform but i had to change my associations and only spoke to people who empowered me who lifted me up who talked about the the person i could become not the person i used to be listen for years for two and a half years i completely disassociated with anybody who brought up my mistakes even though i wasn't that person they were trying to anchor me to that person i'd made the mistake but i become a new man so for two and a half years i disassociated with anyone who tried to hold me to the person i used to be you're not the person you were last month the person you were last year you're here today you're not even the person you were last thursday reward performance this is how we reward performance guys when i say make it a habit out of celebrating everything it just comes out naturally it's no facade they're like oh let me just tell them congratulations because they did the zoom no it's something like this hey mr self i'm so sorry i've got to cancel my zoom he said that's okay let's just reschedule it's no listen why spend five minutes trying to convince them to do something that they already decided they didn't want to do what listen i just you eric thomas talked about he we don't have that kind of time that's okay let's reschedule it i don't need to hear the excuses i don't need i just need to know can we put the activity back on the books but these are things i had to learn i've learned these things in years guys because it allowed me to move quickly now that's okay let's put it on the calendar well you know just um maybe i said let me tell you what i have right you look you can do this as you can do this as a senior manager and so they say um you say well i've got next thursday and next friday at seven o'clock which one's best multiple choice is always good to help people to choose they'll even choose all of the above if they don't know anything you remember that so they say so they say so they say um next next thursday um at seven watch this watch the celebration oh man some of you gonna get this and i said guess what you just did say what you just did twice the amount that most people do in our business most people never even schedule zoom you've scheduled two so far you've done double even though they had to cancel who cares they canceled they actually have one on the books most folks don't ever have a zoom on the books so you actually put two times on the books what most people don't ever do this is what i mean by having it naturally come from you i'm truly excited for them because you actually have scheduled now even maybe they got nervous even though people canceled even though whatever their reasons were the point is that they did something most don't do and you know that so let's not beat up on the folks who are actually giving us the chance to build ourselves to platinum this is what i mean by empowered empowering is lifting up helping people to feel better about themselves seeing a different person you ever see that um that meme where you have a kitty cat looking in a puddle but they see a lion that's empowerment and they only see that lion as a kitty cat because you saw the line in them and you kept speaking lying talk in them lying walk in them okay except failure or lesser performance check this out um when the slide is up there this is this is this is a good one here accept failures or lessons there we go uh no let's go back i didn't press anything that's short yep there we go accept failures as a lesson towards success because it goes hand in hand this is a really good one because if you're not careful most folks because they've been taught this and i was taught in school this you were taught in school this and i get it right i understand the grading system and why it was driving certain behavior if you got a f it was the worst thing if you failed it was the worst thing but in our business guys we got to help people to understand this is very different from what they've experienced out there in the the world outside of our profession outside of legal shield and network marketing because here every single failure is a signpost towards their goals it goes hand in hand without a failure i wouldn't have known to turn left the failure was nothing i want you to visually see this when anyone fails see a signpost and when someone fails it says man that was in the right direction it's left now so they go left a little bit and all of a sudden they bump their head again well that was a dead end make a u-turn these are all signposts and every failure is a signpost that's all it is and all of us need these signposts in our life i need to sign posts in my relationships with my wife sign posting my relationships with my kids because there's no real book on parenting and they're books on parenting but every child is different every parent is different and every relationship between the parent and the child is different yes and every every peer that they have is going to influence them differently which also in which also impacts the relationship it's the same thing in our business so yes i could teach you here's what i say to every single person but you don't have the same relationship with the person that you're leading as a relationship i have with the person i'm leading plus the person that you're leading has a different situation than the person that i'm leading so that's why yes you can take all these notes but just understand either way you're going to have signposts either way you're gonna have to yield and don't ever seem listen don't ever feel like because you took two steps backwards that you were retreating you were just yielding and that's how i was in martial arts when i fought the big dudes going for my black belt i was taught how to use their weight against them i mean going against someone at 300 pounds and i was 220 at the time you you can't stand toe you shouldn't stand toe-to-toe right but i learned how to what seemed like a retreat was just to yield to elbow with their own weight i hope you guys are getting this every single thing i do in business every single thing you'll do in business is just a signpost either a signpost and say yes keep going green light or signpost state will slow down for a little bit because you're moving a little too fast more people are quitting than our joining your organization but if we don't pay attention to these signposts we just keep going and unfortunately we're going fast in the wrong direction every single time someone fails in your business stop looking as a failure but start looking at it as a signpost because they go hand in hand they're all lessons yes the last thing i want to share on this slide we got one more slide is remind folks of their why this is huge and empowering leaders i remind people that why all the time but guess what you got to do in order to remind people that why know their why know their why guess what i forget people wise all the time i say hey can you can you remind me refresh my memory what should why so even if you don't remember it look i again please don't take this as d self up here being perfect i am so i wish that all of you had a chance to work with me because you would not look at me as someone who knows it all you will look at me as someone who's willing to admit how much they don't know which is what i do with my team all the time i'm always willing to say i'm not really sure i don't remember that don't recall let me call you back hey listen so refresh my memory what's your why again and then they tell me that why this is how i can now say to them hey listen so is that why strong enough to keep you moving forward in legal shield or do you believe that the reason you just gave me that you feel like you should stop is stronger than the why you just shared with me i can't say that unless you remind me of your why if you're sitting next to someone right now and they're on your team you don't remember their why that's a great assignment for you when you leave to ask them hey can you refresh my memory where's your why some of them need to revisit their wives anyway last slide guys we're talking about empowering leaders in the beginning i said how many of you all would like to develop independent leaders and almost everyone raised their hand i would like it independently do you know what an independent leader is independent leader invited people to come here without you when you had all the power teams that had all the you know different groups and seat special scene that came up on stage you know that six out of ten of those uh folks who had the top power team uh attendees here or within my organization but i wasn't on the top ten i wasn't on the top i can't even take they would give me credit just because of the culture of the team they would give me credit oh mrs but i can't take credit for that for mike hughes being number one mike humes did the work because he's an independent leader i can't take credit for karen beverly being number three new circle of champion members by the way and new millionaire club member why because she did the work you guys get what i'm saying and then some of the folks are below other folks who maybe you don't even know all of that guys this is why some of you are sitting here right now and i'm so excited for you because some of you are sitting here right now as a senior manager and by the time we come together in oklahoma you'll be a silver executive director watch what i say watch what i say because of this last piece last piece we got to enter two minutes because this last piece who are you spending your time with and how often are you spending your time with listen guys i'm talking about mike keems this whole time because this this was when i learned the most lessons i learned the most lessons with mike humes i made the most mistakes with mike humes that's why i'm so blessed that he's still around because he can be like dude seriously say you're sorry again i'm quitting but most of you don't know that right but who you're spending your time with and how often check this out the reason why i believe that mike humes decided to follow was because he saw that i had vision to go somewhere that his circle he was around didn't see themselves going let me say it one more time the reason i believe that mike humes followed me was because i had vision and where we were headed and i said man you should go with me you should come with me here's where we'll be a year from now next year won't look like this year i talked about where we could be a year from now in a way that the circle he hung out with were not they talked about the day they talked about the game they talked about half time they talked to you guys i talked about our game the game to retire your mom the game to retire yourself the game to become financially independent the game to be able to give away more money than we made the game where we can wake up in the morning when we're finished sleeping the game where we've empowered thousands of people the game where every single month man you and i will hang out and say where you want to go look we won't have to ask permission we'll say to each other hey but what you're doing next tuesday let's go hang out it's going to be a different day for you when you empower people to become independent leaders because as they grow you grow do not leave this conference thinking that you're not good enough i want you to know as eric thomas said you're the right person i just need you to find the people direct them to people who have a greater leadership skill than you plug them in watch them grow and when they grow you're going to grow no more self doubt no more low sighted living no more dwarf goals you're the point now where you can grow you can take your business to the next level and i will see you guys at the top god bless [Music]
