# File 7: Your First 48 Hours - Darnell Self Captions

## Introduction: Welcome
Greetings and welcome to the PPLSI family. My name is Darnell Self. I've been working from home in Maryland for over 20 years because of this amazing company.

## First 48 Hours
It's your first 48 hours, and if I had to do it all again, I would do it just like this. Find a local event and attend. Proximity has power. Get around the most successful associates.

## Fast Start Qualification
We want to get you paid and promoted, called fast start qualified. The company gives you 20 days to earn your bonuses. Why not do it in your first two days?

## Getting Customers
To get fast start qualified, you need three customers and one business partner. One of those customers might become an associate. This increases your belief level.

## Accessing Information
Gain access to information quickly. There are videos that will show you how to launch and structure your business.

## Three-Way Calls
Use three-way calls to get expert help in answering questions. This way, you learn while your prospect gets the answers they need.

## Continuous Learning
You have access to many resources in your back office. Gain that information and education to become more competent and confident.

## Conclusion
I'm excited for you. I can't wait to celebrate your first rank advancement. Welcome again to the PPLSI family.
