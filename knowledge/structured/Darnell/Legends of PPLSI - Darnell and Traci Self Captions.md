This tells Darnell and Traci Self story, from humble beggining to became successful entrepreneurs. It covers their early struggles, their belief and faith, their gratefulness and humility, and their commitment to empowering others.

This is The story, as told by Darnell:

    "Once we decided to be entrepreneurs, it was not a cakewalk from there. We're from the Washington DC, Maryland area. My father drove the Metro Bus, and my mother worked for the government. We didn't have a lot of money, so I worked retail all through college to make extra money.

    One day while working at the mall, this pretty girl walked by. She said, "Man, it's fine. I'm going to get a job in there." That's my version; she can tell her version later. She got a job at the store, we dated, got married, and now here we are, 27 years later.

    In the beginning of our business, Traci thought I was crazy. She didn't have much belief in the business, only in me. We were borrowing money, paying bills late, and just wanted to pay the bills. Traci said, "If this is going to pay the bills, just do it."

    Despite the struggles, we pushed through. We had faith and always believed. The tough times made us different and brought us to where we are today. Our family is our greatest achievement, and the time flexibility allowed us to be there for important moments.

    We never forget where we came from and remain grateful. We are being used as tools by God, and our season of preparation reminds us of that. We speak from our hearts with authenticity.

    Success is not just about what we have but how many people we have helped. Our success comes from successful people we have poured into, directly and indirectly. They made the decision to change, and we guided them.

    Our own children are now developing successful businesses, including LegalShield. This opportunity makes us smile because it means we're creating a legacy."
