**Additional Details:**
- A recruit must pay the current associate fee and have or purchase a legal membership or IDShield in licensed states.
- Associates that advance to Manager must attend a Fast Start Training class within their first 45 days to be eligible to earn a bonus.
- Associates that advance to Manager but do not attend a Fast Start Training class within their first 45 days will not be eligible to earn a bonus.
- To find Fast Start Training, go to [LegalShield Calendar](https://legalshieldcalendar.com/) and enter “Fast Start” into the search bar. Select one of the available trainings and click “Join Event.”
- To receive credit for attending the class and be eligible for the bonus, you must stay online and engaged until the end. All associates must enter their name and associate number into the Zoom chat to receive credit at the beginning and end of class.
- A reinstated associate must be canceled for three years for the writing agent to receive credit.
- All qualifying associates must have an active LegalShield Advantage or Advantage Plus subscription.
- The sponsor bonus is paid to the recruiting associate. This would be the sponsor unless the associate was placed under the sponsor. Then, the bonus would go to the placing associate.
- The upline Senior Director and Executive Director are determined at the time of recruitment (not qualification).
- The first upline Platinum at the time of recruitment (not qualification) will receive a $200 bonus.
- All bonuses will be held for 5 business days once earned for a business review and can be held up to 60 days for retention review if cancels or precancels are higher than the company average.
- New upline sponsors who do not have retention data for the previous month (due to their business being new) are subject to bonuses being held for a 60-day retention review.
- To receive any upline bonus, the associate must have a previous month-end organizational retention rate of 65% or higher.
- Associates with less than 12 months of retention data or associates with the majority of their business in the last three months will be evaluated for retention. The evaluation will be based on the company average for that time period and by the Business Health Index, which calculates future persistency based on associate data.
- All associates must be in good standing with the company to receive incentives, including bonuses or trips. Any associate that is currently being sanctioned or on hold status will not be eligible.

**Legal Terms:**
- By participating in any LegalShield incentive or bonus program and to receive benefits, cash or otherwise, the associate agrees to have his/her full name, associate title, level, or standing published and recognized in LegalShield marketing materials, whether oral, written, or electronic.
- LegalShield reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to review all incentives and bonuses, business submitted or activity, and where necessary, in its sole discretion, delay or stop payment of any bonus, to charge back bonuses when appropriate, and to amend or revoke this incentive, or any part thereof, at any time.
- This incentive or bonus program is not a separate contract and no guarantee or promise of increased income or business is implied. Individual results and success as an independent sales associate depend on individual effort and abilities.
- For statistics on actual earnings, please review the Income Disclosure Statement at [wearelegalshield.com/income-disclosure](https://wearelegalshield.com/income-disclosure).
