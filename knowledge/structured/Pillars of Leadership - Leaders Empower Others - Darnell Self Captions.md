# File 5: Pillars of Leadership - Leaders Empower Others - Darnell Self Captions

## Introduction: Leadership and Empowerment
Tonight, I have the opportunity to share a little about leading and empowering others. This event is about becoming better leaders, which makes everything around us better.

## Learning from Mistakes
I've learned through years of mistakes and leading a diverse group. I'm not perfect and don't strive for perfection but for excellence. I'm going to share how to build an organization of independent leaders.

## Building Independent Leaders
In our industry, you guide your team to people who can lead them. You can be a two and have tens on your team who go executive, and because they go executive, you go platinum.

## Empowering Others
Leaders become great not because of their power but their ability to empower others. Your job is to guide your team, not necessarily lead them directly.

## Influence and Communication
Influence is the capacity to direct the behaviors of others. Effective communication and celebrating wins are crucial. Listening is more important than talking.

## Celebrating and Course Correcting
Celebrate small wins and help people course-correct. This builds trust and empowers them. Lower assignments if necessary to help them do more.

## Lessons from Failures
Accept failures as lessons towards success. Every failure is a signpost towards your goals. Help your team understand this mindset.

## Knowing Their Why
Remind your team of their why. This keeps them motivated and moving forward. Regularly revisit and understand their why.

## Developing Independent Leaders
An independent leader invites people to events without you. They can lead their teams independently. Spend time with the right people and help them grow.

## Conclusion
Empower others to become independent leaders. Your growth comes from helping others grow. No more self-doubt; you are the right person to lead. Take your business to the next level. See you at the top. God bless.
