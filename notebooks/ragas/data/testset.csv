How does belief play a crucial role in achieving success and overcoming challenges in network marketing?,"[""The name of my talk is is up to me. and that's because it is up to you. You can't count on anybody else you could blame a lot of people, but it's up to you. Now what's going to help you out as I go through this this talk? Is to realize that everything happens for you not to you. Repeat after me everything happens for me. Not to me. So that means my first network marketing company when it costs $5,000 to get started that actually happened for me. because when I got to LegalShield It was 249 dollars for me to ask the folks and I was used to asking for $5,000. And I was around Folks at the meetings and they were saying things like you know, and it's 249 dollars to get started almost apologetic. for asking for $249 But not me. Because the company where I failed I was used to asking for $5,000. So when I got the LegalShield I said and guess what the best part is. It's only 249 dollars. You have an opportunity to change the rest of your life and you're not gonna believe this for 250. Like is that crazy? So my posture my delivery was different because of $5,000 was happening for me. The first training I went to in this industry was 300 bucks. It was called a basic training in that company. It's equivalent to the fast start training class here. And it was $300 to go to that training. Here when I went to my first fast start training. I don't remember how much it was like maybe 10 or 20 bucks Brown. I'm not sure how much it was whatever it was. I was like and guess what folks who have succeeded. Well, actually teach you in coach you for like 20 bucks. And folks some people like, you know, you do does it cost. You know, how much is it's 15 dollars. So that happened for me to 300 bucks the Super Saturday event in that training in that company was called in advance training. So you got basic in advance. That was a super Saturday here super Saturday here what 20 bucks 25 bucks? $30 at the door, maybe. Six hundred dollars to go to Super Saturday event there. $600 per person that was happening for me. I didn't make any money there. But God Was preparing me to get started with the company to charge 20 bucks for a Super Saturday event. So I had a head start. That's want you to know that because I don't want you to compare yourself to me. I want you to know I had a head start. I had an opportunity to say and guess what? People flying in the best of the best will be coming or hey, we should get in the car and drive to Ohio to drive to Georgia all the things we did. Because we can actually hear from the best of the best and you're not gonna believe this $20. They're like what I'm like, I know it's crazy. Like I mean people should we get to go let's get everybody for 20. It was almost like we were sneaking in. But guess what? If you're not seeing that type of value in our leadership, you're actually hesitant to say that it cost. People even say to you are there any additional costs once I get started? And we almost shy away from it. No, not really. Hello. No, the best part is you're not gonna believe this you get an opportunity to hear from those who are earning six figures in some cases more. for $20 This is why I had so much success my first year because I came from somewhere and it all happened for me not to me didn't make any money. So while it was happening, I thought it was happening to me, but I quickly learned that it was all happening for me. Somebody's in a position right now in this room that you're not happy about and the reason why I thought I share with you that is happening for you because I want you to look at your current situation and gain the lessons from it and realize why that's happening so that that way you can say man. I'm looking for what's happening for me. So this one thing that I want you to sift. You've heard it several times every single speaker said this word out of their mouth. I was taking notes. Every single speaker said this one word out of their mouth because it is the Difference Maker it is the thing that will close the chasm the difference between back there and up here. And that is belief. now believe is what you would call truth. So let's talk about belief because unfortunately some of the things that we have been believing all this time, we've been believing for some reason and it's held us back from the things that you've been called to do. You've been purpose to do the things, you know, you can do before whatever reason you started talking yourself out of doing it.

What are the key steps and strategies recommended for maximizing success in your first 48 hours with the company?,"[""Greetings and welcome to the pplsi family. My name is Darnell self. I'm here in my home in Maryland. I've been working out of my home now for over 20 years because of this amazing company, but guess what? It's not about me. I know it's your first 48 hours, but guess what? I had my first 48 Hours as well. And if I had to do it all again, I would do it just like this. I would find out where a local event is in my area so that I could attend that event because being in the right rooms, like proximity has power I would get around those who are the most successful in the great thing is we have a hybrid company. So some of that's gonna be in person and some of that is via Zoom or technology that you'll be able to link in with successful associate. So one hour get around the most successful Associates as fast as I could now when I got started the next event was Atlanta Georgia and I live in Maryland. So that's about a 10-hour drive. But because I understood being around the most successful people and being mentored by the most successful people I drove there and I'm asking that you do that. I'm saying your First 48 hours though at least find out where some of those events are taking place and put it on your calendar. Number two. We want to get you paid in promoting. Get you paid and promoted we call it fast start qualified. Now. The company says hey you get 20 days to become fast our qualified to earn your bonuses. A lot of people waiting to the 19th in the 20th day, which is two days. So if that's the case, why not do it your first two days like your first 48 hours if it's gonna take you two days to do it. Anyway do it your first two days. So what is what does that mean? Well one you have to take your fast start training class. So make sure you find out when that is and take that as soon as you can but you can already go out and get your first handful of customers and your one business partner because oh you need three customers and one of those customers is probably gonna say well, can I make money off of this too? You say sure you can share with other people. So they become an associate we call that three and one three customers. One of those customers becomes an associate right just like you and you went to your faster training class. You're now fast or qualified. so one that increases your belief level right like man, I hit my first rank already number two, it increases your belief because you got paid you're not to say I heard that guy from Maryland who talks really fast who invited me to the company who said welcome to me in the first 48 Hours set it you can say I know Right, it's different when you say I know so so allow us to help you get paid and promoted as soon as possible again, it gives you your belief it also gives you a testimony so that when others say, how's it going for you can say, you know, all right made a little bit of money. The extra money is nice. It's a testimony. It's your belief check. So I'm excited about you getting that deposit. And then finally if I would do it all over again, I have my first my first 48 hours all over again, I would access as much information as fast as I could now, there's several videos that you'll have access to that will share with you how to launch your business for an example. You can put a lot of people together one platform like a zoom platform. All right even have them in your house if you want to and you can have a guest speaker someone who's already well versed at doing the presentation jump on that Zoom platform and do a presentation for years your grand opening you hear about that one of the videos if you're like, hey this I'm not really sure how I would really build. Business you're going to have a video on how to build how to structure your business out. So that my point is that you have access today say well listen, I don't even know how to answer questions great. We call that a three-way call you have access to an expert that you can get your guests your prospect on the phone with them. They'll answer the questions for you in front of you that way now you're learning how to do it yourself in this awesome and your prospect was able to get the answers that they need it to make an intelligent wise and well informed decision. Is all work together and there's a training course on three-way calling. So my point is I would gain access to all the information I could as fast as I could which is by the way what I did back then don't judge me. They were cassette tapes. Now you have right there in your back office you have right here where you're watching this and you can gain that information that education which makes you more competent and""]","The key steps and strategies recommended for maximizing success in your first 48 hours with the company include finding local events to attend, getting around the most successful associates, becoming fast start qualified by getting three customers and one business partner, accessing fast start training classes, accessing information and training videos on launching and structuring your business, utilizing three-way calls for answering questions, and gaining access to expert advice and resources as quickly as possible.",simple,"[{'source': '../../knowledge/originals/Your First 48 Hours - Darnell Self Captions.txt', 'filename': '../../knowledge/originals/Your First 48 Hours - Darnell Self Captions.txt'}]",True
"How can celebrating wins as a leader help others feel good about moving forward, even if it surpasses your own success?","["" understanding influence leaders have the capacity or the ability to direct the behaviors of others that's influence right so what you're doing is you're guiding the behavior of someone else you're helping someone else to do something that without your influence they wouldn't have done now watch this because this influence is critical and i've listened to the young pros talk about effective communication i've listened to all of our trainers throughout the weekend talk about the importance of celebrating wins which we'll talk about here as well but i want to help you guys really understand the importance of helping other people to feel good about moving forward even if it passes you up now this is this comes from language because if they feel like you don't want them to pass you and and look i i understand competition but if anyone feels like my leader's trying to hold me back my leader doesn't want to see me succeed my leader we have to take a look at look in the mirror and wonder why they feel that way instead of saying i can't believe you think that way they think that way for a reason and they listen they're entitled to think that way but as a great leader we look in the mirror and say how what am i saying or doing or not saying or not doing to to help them or to to to get get them to to feel that way so i wrote down a got a couple of bullet points for you that's going to help you out that helped me out so i thought i'd share with you all one ask permission to coach to improve their performance you guys got that one down ask permission this is going to be critical for you so i don't want to move too fast i need you guys to get that down you ask permission so it sounds something like this hey listen um i'm really excited about uh your potential here with legalshield and you know i'm just getting started myself or having all the success that i would like to but i'm connected to people who are doing extraordinarily well and i'd love to introduce you to them so even in asking permission to coach to improve their performance it doesn't mean that you're personally going to coach them but you can connect them to someone who's going to coach them you guys getting this if you say well i don't have a leader that i can connect someone with you have now opportunities virtually to still connect people once they join legalshield you have leadership shows and you can promote we have some of the most successful coaches and mentors and when you join this particular zoom we have at this date this time you're gonna have an opportunity to learn from the same people that are teaching me this is how i was able to impact my kim's performance before i was succeeding i was able to talk about other people so if you talk to mike humes and and talk about his first few years with me he'll talk about how i introduced him to certain people who were driving nicer cars than me who had more success than me so i was very intentional about that but how do you know how to guide these folks because people say a lot of different things and they confuse us right they say they're excited but they don't do anything right they say oh man i'm gonna be a millionaire but they don't show up on the zoom so watch this watch the difference between a a leader and a great leader because we're teaching how to become great leaders here this weekend that's why i'm glad you showed up in youtube virtually watch the difference a good leader still listens but they're listening to respond they're not listening to receive and the difference sounds like this your associate says something like hey listen um i'm just so stressed i feel like it's overwhelming so many calls so many zooms so many things going on a good leader not a great leader he listened she listened but they respond with something like this come on you're not stressed i mean going to your job is stressful so a good leader didn't really care what they said because that person just said they felt stressed so what they've what they're feeling is what they're feeling you can't tell them they're not feeling something they just told you they were feeling but a great leader says oh my gosh i'm so sorry to hear that what no what do you feel what what are the reasons why you're feeling so stressed let's talk about this and they have an opportunity to really hear what that person's feeling and why they're feeling and then they can say things like hey listen is there anything i can do to assist you is there anything i can do to help well listen they say well listen so many different calls so listen right now just worry about this one and this one because you're part-time but you didn't realize that until you had this conversation with him and now you took him from attending four different things throughout the week to two or maybe two to one i'm gonna

How has digital innovation in the justice system affected access to affordable legal services through a $1/day mobile app in the US?,"["" for money. But then this leverage income when you're in a collaboration with someone right just you and a team of people like real estate works, like like that insurance works like that where you can be a real estate broker have real estate agents. The agent sells a home in a broker still makes a percentage leverage income if you're busy you want to make money while you're busy be careful. Listen to folks say one busy and they're only making money on linear income the key is when you're busy to still make money from other opportunities why you're busy doing the things you love busy traveling busy with your family. So it's okay to be busy. As long as you're making money from other opportunities while you're busy we'll talk about that residual income means you do something one time and you get paid for it over and over again for it. Now the project that I started when I was 28 years old. It's been around for 50 years now starting. 1972 we have 4.4 million customers that we already protect with the services that we provide and these services are for everybody the opportunity side to make money is not for everybody. It's not everybody's interested in that I get it but this services will share in just a little bit for everybody. So 4.4 million people already take advantage of what I'm gonna shoot share with you. It's awesome. Our vision is to provide equal access to the Liberty equality opportunity and Justice that everybody deserves and I know you would agree with that. We've been written up in all types of third party sources and that's important Mike because people like well, I'm tired of get rich Quicks companies that are here today gone out of business tomorrow. So you're looking at a company that's Solid Rock Solid 50 years old. Now we're part of disruptive innovation. That's a space where you take an existing model and you make it simpler easier and more affordable Amazon did that to retail industry Netflix to the video rental industry. Let's see Uber has done it to this Transportation industry. Airbnb is now doing it to the accommodations industry. So you familiar with disruptive innovation also termed digital disruptors. So we've done the same thing with the justice system. We know at 300 miles an hour. The average person has never had access to justice is it people been priced out of it? Because they check their checkbooks before they check their rights. And as you can tell I'm passionate about what I do because I believe all of us deserve access to our rights. And so with this one mobile app for a dollar a day you have access to everything. I'm gonna go I'm gonna go over look. I I've been doing this for 24 years, right? I started when I was 28 and 52 and I've never had anyone tell me a dollar a day. That's too much for Lord You're not right? How do you sleep at night charging a dollar a day for lawyer? No, it's ever said that to me ever. The only thing most of said to me is how can you do it for a dollar a day? Like they can't understand why so inexpensive we've taken a $300 an hour product. It made it a dollar a day typically in marketing or even sales you're taking a product and hold. So you're selling it retail. So your marketing it up. We've marked the product down. So people like they can't wrap your minds around. It was not your dollar a day or my dollar a day when we just said no to people have it over a million people paying a dollar day share.

lessons with mike humes i made the most mistakes with mike humes that's why i'm so blessed that he's still around because he can be like dude seriously say you're sorry again i'm quitting but most of you don't know that right but who you're spending your time with and how often check this out the reason why i believe that mike humes decided to follow was because he saw that i had vision to go somewhere that his circle he was around didn't see themselves going let me say it one more time the reason i believe that mike humes followed me was because i had vision and where we were headed and i said man you should go with me you should come with me here's where we'll be a year from now next year won't look like this year i talked about where we could be a year from now in a way that the circle he hung out with were not they talked about the day they talked about the game they talked about half time they talked to you guys i talked about our game the game to retire your mom the game to retire yourself the game to become financially independent the game to be able to give away more money than we made the game where we can wake up in the morning when we're finished sleeping the game where we've empowered thousands of people the game where every single month man you and i will hang out and say where you want to go look we won't have to ask permission we'll say to each other hey but what you're doing next tuesday let's go hang out it's going to be a different day for you when you empower people to become independent leaders because as they grow you grow do not leave this conference thinking that you're not good enough i want you to know as eric thomas said you're the right person i just need you to find the people direct them to"", ""so tonight i have an opportunity real quickly just to share a little bit about leading and empowering others this whole weekend was really about leadership and i prefaced that yesterday when i talked about this being different than our international convention this is an event where we have an opportunity to just become better and when we become better things around us become better because we see them as better even when the circumstances don't change it's the way you see the circumstance that change thereby it's seemingly changing and so what i want to talk about are some things that i've learned throughout my years of bumping my head and making a bunch of mistakes and leading a diverse group and i'm still making those mistakes by the way so this presentation isn't coming from a person that's perfected it because i actually don't even strive for perfection i strive for excellence and so perfection i'll never reach but i'm going to share with you all today some things that you can do to build an organization of independent leaders how many people want to build independent leaders now eric thomas yesterday said that it's in this i'm paraphrasing that is quite difficult if you're a one to lead anybody except to zero you all remember that which is true except for our industry it's so beautiful to be a part of a profession where you actually are not always the one leading the people on your team you're guiding the people on your team to people who can now lead those people on your team and what i want to teach you tonight is how to be a one but lead eight listen i don't want you to look at yourself in the mirror and say i'm not good enough i've got to wait until i become a nine before i can even introduce a ten and it's simply not the case in our profession this is why we are a part of the most beautiful industry in the world because you could absolutely be 82 years old and feel like i don't want to work that hard i'm 82 i've worked hard all of my life and introduced a 27 year old who works harder than you who does more than you and you benefit from it at 82. you could absolutely be a female and introduce a male who has an issue with being led by a female which i would never understand but that does exist yes let's talk facts so you can be a female and introduce a male who has a challenge with being led by a female but could still lead an entire team of men as a female who has entire team of men who bump their heads so hard that they have a problem with being led by a female you could have a ged never graduate from high school right or maybe you ended up getting the ged and still lead a team of folks who have phds and master degrees this is why you have no excuse i don't even know some of you and i can tell you that you too can be a platinum executive director because you too can be a two and have tens on your team who go executive and because those four people go executive you go platinum and you did not necessarily lead them to platinum you guided them to platinum [Applause] that's what i'm going to teach over the next few minutes you all ready [Applause] leadership so leaders become great not because of their power but rather their ability to empower others listen to what that says leaders become great not because of their own power but rather their ability to empower others so this doesn't have anything to do with your power but your ability to help others to feel empowered do you realize that you could have invited people here today and you didn't necessarily empower them but your ability to guide them here has them leaving feeling empowered see i'm taking it all off of you you have no excuses leaving here and not saying you can't go executive unless you're putting it all on you i'm going to show you how to how to take it off of you but yet to still have leaders who believe in you how do i know this is true because when mike humes joined our organization he had more than me he he had the car i was borrowing my father's pickup truck back then you had to have good credit to get a cell phone not sure if that's still true today but i could even get a cell phone except on his credit so if it was true in our industry that you could not lead anyone who's doing better than you then be no way that i could have guided mike humes to the position he's in today that should excite you today but you're probably wondering like how do you do it i'm gonna share that with you because i know some of you are still thinking well i just don't if you could just show me how to do that because yes i i know some people who are very influential in my community i have some family members who have accomplished a lot more than me i'm just unsure how to help them to feel empowered to do what i'm doing because they're looking at me they're they're judging me they're deciding whether they should be interested or not based on my own success in legal shield anybody know people like that so let's talk about""]",The answer to given
